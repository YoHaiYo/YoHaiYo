# 👋 Hi, I'm YoHaiYo

### 🌉 From Designing Bridges to Designing Code

Hello! I'm YoHaSim, a passionate web developer based in South Korea. My journey began as a bridge structural designer, where I learned the beauty of creating something strong and enduring. Now, I've transitioned into the world of web development, where I craft digital experiences that are as impactful as the bridges I once designed.

### 🌐 My Passion: Indie Hacking

I'm not just here to code; I'm here to build. As an aspiring **Indie Hacker**, my goal is to create, distribute, and monetize my own projects, turning ideas into real-life services that bring value to people. Every line of code I write is a step toward realizing this dream.
